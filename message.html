<div class="card">
    <p>
        I dont say this enough,  but i love you so much and youre the best thing thats ever happened to me,
        the moment you entered my life, you flipped it 180 degrees to the better, even when we were still friends,
        you showed me how to care for someone without getting anything in return, you showed me what kindness is,
        you showed me how to love and adore someone more than anything in my life
        you taught me how to handle things i never handled like a mature person and will always aim to have you by my side.
    </p>
    <p>
        i love the way you smile, laugh, chuckle, EVEN SNEEZE AND COUGH
